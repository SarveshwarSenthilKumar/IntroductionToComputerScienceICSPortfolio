<h1>Sarveshwar Senthil Kumar: Introduction to Computer Science (ICS3U) Notes</h1>
<text>This website is made to house all my projects and notes for the Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science course.</text>
<br><br>
<text>This course is comprised mainly of programming basics using a customized version of Java on a "flexible software sketchbook" named Processing which is a beginner-friendly tuned down version of Java for beginner tasks as well as easy use in graphics rendering for intensive tasks such as game development. The software can be found at <a href="https://processing.org">https://processing.org</a>.</text>
